# What is this?
This is a Vim function that is used for fast creation of a verilog module instantiation template. Some other functionality would be cool, such as:
- State Machine Template Generator
- Basic Module template

# What can it do?
Currently the feature set is small, but here is what it can do
- Make a template from a file that is in the same directory

# What do I want it to do?
These are just a few features that would make this a more useful tool in a real workflow
- Look at a broader set of files starting from a given directory 
- Ignores single line comments above the module \<module_name\> verilog construct that start at the beginning of the line
- More if anyone thinks of anything
